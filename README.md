# Metrobus User Application

METROBUS is a public bus transportation service app that enhances sustainability by improving route efficiency, encouraging public transit use, and supporting better urban planning. By leveraging real-time traffic data through APIs like Google Maps API, the app dynamically adjusts routes based on live conditions, reducing congestion and optimizing transit schedules. This minimizes delays, improves bus frequency, and ensures accurate ETAs, making public transportation a more attractive alternative to personal vehicles. Additionally, real-time tracking helps reduce unnecessary idling, which lowers fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 

The app also provides auditors with access to authentication logs, system activities, and anomaly detection records, ensuring secure operations and data integrity in line with ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC) principles. By analyzing collected data, city planners can identify high-demand areas, optimize underused routes, and enhance urban mobility, ultimately creating a more efficient and environmentally friendly transit system.

SIGSAC plays a crucial role in designing and maintaining security mechanisms in applications that utilize json web tokens (JWT) authentication. Our app applies these SIGSAC principles to ensure secure user authentication and access control, safeguarding sensitive data like user credentials and payment information. JWT authentication enables secure session management, allowing users to access routes, maps, stops, and ticket purchasing features without repeatedly logging in. For auditors, SIGSAC guidelines help implement robust logging and monitoring systems, ensuring they can view authentication logs, system activities, and anomaly detection records. This enables early detection of security threats, unauthorized access attempts, and operational inconsistencies, aligning with best practices in security auditing and control. 

In the future, we plan to integrate a Flask microservice REST API with formal verification to ensure Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) are secure and verifiable, assigning predefined roles like users and auditors to prevent unauthorized actions. Real-time monitoring with machine learning (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) will detect anomalies, while blockchain technology might enhance auditability and prevent unauthorized route changes using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). These measures ensure the METROBUS app remains secure, scalable, and resilient, supporting efficient urban transit while safeguarding system integrity.
